# ComicCrafter

ComicCrafter is a Python-based tool that generates comic-style stories using Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation models like Stable Diffusion. The tool takes a story prompt, breaks it into scenes with dialogue and descriptions, and then generates corresponding images using ComicDiffusion. Itâ€™s designed for fun storytelling, automation, and creative projects.
